# Writing a Grant _(Digital Performance: 2020 and COVID-19)_

As the semester is coming to an end, our time in class for the last few weeks has been focused on our final project: writing a grant for a theoretical digital humanities project. We were effectively given free reign with choosing a topic, so naturally, I chose one related to theater. I wanted to focus on something within my field of study because I felt I’d be the most passionate about that. (Considering the amount of writing and content that goes into a single grant, I wanted to make sure I’d have the proper passion for it!)

COVID-19 has certainly changed how not just theater, but all live entertainment, has functioned for the majority of 2020. In particular, almost all productions have had to be digitally produced in some manner. Because of the unique fleeting nature of digital media, especially when copyright is involved for theater, I wanted to create an archive of digital productions throughout 2020. Each production would have its own individual page with any material still available online included or linked to (within the limitations of copyright), and there would be a summary of how each production adapted to the digital medium. Additionally, a timeline feature would be included to place all of the productions featured in chronological order. This is essential to give context on what conditions COVID-19 would have created at that time.

Doing research for this theoretical project was somewhat difficult. Theater is a field that has resisted any sort of transition to digital before, so the last year has been very new territory. There isn’t an incredibly large amount of scholarship on theater being digital due to that — but I certainly think that will change after this year! However, what I was able to find was fairly informative about how existing theatrical archives work. While not a perfect match, it was a good base for me to think further on how I wanted my own archive to look and function.

My project did not immensely change after its proposal, but Dr. Stover did give me some solid points on how and where to refine it before moving forward. Originally, I had made the scope of my project far too broad; I hadn’t specified what productions would be included in the archive! I decided to focus on collegiate-level productions. Since the inspiration for this project was TheaterCNU’s production of The Living, I wanted to keep my focus on productions similar to it. Additionally, some of the programs and technology I mentioned in the proposal may not remain the same for the final grant. In hindsight, I don’t think I did enough research into what options I might have. Because of that, I want to go back and reconsider some things to make sure this project would be both achievable and of the best quality possible if actually created. Together, I think keeping both of those changes in mind will be a great help in refining the rest of my work on this project!

Unfortunately, I don’t have as many concrete thoughts on my environmental scan because I overlapped many parts of it with what should be in the grant narrative. While I think most everything I included in my original environmental scan has its place within the grant, it does need to be revised and split into the two separate documents correctly. Luckily, this does make writing my grant narrative easier, since I’ve already created a lot of the material for it!

This coming week will mostly be spent on that revision and drafting up my budget for the project. I really wasn’t sure of where to go with that at first, since I didn’t think creating a website would have too many costs involved. Luckily, after discussion in class, I had a better idea of what would be good to include. Things like purchasing a domain, server costs, possible graphic design elements, any paid software, and more are important things for me to consider, even if I don’t come near the $1500 limit. Overall, I feel much more secure in how to proceed with the rest of the project. I look forward to posting my final update soon!
