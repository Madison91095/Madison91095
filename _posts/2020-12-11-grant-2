# Finalizing a Grant Proposal

(This post is a continuation of “Grant Proposal: Part One”! If you haven’t read that yet, I’d recommend clicking [here](https://madison91095.github.io/Madison91095/2020/11/20/grant-1.html) first.)

With this semester coming to a close, our grant proposal projects are nearly due as well alongside the end of this course! Not much has changed about the project since the last post; however, I did make one key change in how I wanted to develop the rest of the proposal going forward. I was repeatedly struggling with being able to concisely explain and summarize my project idea, which is critical in any proposal. Thus, I challenged myself to make a one paragraph summary to refer back to and base my work on, as seen below:

I am proposing to create a digital archive of collegiate theatrical productions from 2020. Specifically, this archive will cover the unique nature of live entertainment no longer being able to be held in person, thus necessitating a variety of new production styles. Each production will be documented with its own page, preserving as much information as possible about the event for future viewing and study. These pages will be able to be accessed in two ways. First, there will be a general search feature that can be narrowed down through a variety of parameters. Additionally, there will be a chronological, timeline view for best context in relation to the pandemic’s state at that time.

Hopefully that gives a better explanation of what my final project is centered around! In hindsight, I wish I would have made something like that before my last post, but it at least gives me the ability to correct some issues before the final submission. I think having that core summary paragraph will be very helpful in fixing some specific problems I have identified with my current grant proposal. First, while the deadline for completing this project is fairly soon, there are still a few things I want to adjust before then. First, I still think my environmental scan needs some revision. My current final paragraph is scattered and currently more fitting for a grant narrative. There are some portions that support the rest of the research well, but as the comments I’ve gotten point out, it needs some restructuring for full effectiveness. 

Similarly, I want to make sure my project is cohesive. All of the pieces may have been written separately, but they’re still all part of the same grant. Since they were written over a fairly long period of time, part of my final revisions will be making sure there aren’t any inconsistencies between each part. Additionally, if there is something I incorporated in later parts, I may go back and revise earlier pieces to both match and be as strong as they can be content-wise.

Overall, I am very happy with my progress and really enjoyed getting to make a grant proposal of my own. This class in general covered a lot of material and ideas that I had never worked with before. I’m not sure if my future will ever involve writing grant proposals of my own, but even if not, this class gave me a much stronger appreciation of both digital humanities and some of the lesser-known requirements of academia. If you’ve read all of my posts so far, thank you so much for being a part of this assignment, and I hope you’ve enjoyed it!
