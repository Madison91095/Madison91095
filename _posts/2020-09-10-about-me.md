Hello! I’m Madison Ferris, a senior currently enrolled at Christopher Newport University. This is my blog for the ENGL 350: Writing for the Digital Humanities course. I chose this course in particular because I was looking for a final Writing Intensive course that would best compliment my work in theater. I both wanted to learn how to communicate better through digital platforms and find out how digital humanities would intersect with my field, so I’m excited to take this course!

I am a theater design/tech student at CNU, mainly focused on sound design and engineering. (I do occasionally work on lighting and electrics, though!) Mostly recently, I served as the sound designer for the CNU 2019 One-Act Play Festival and the sound engineer for _The Drowsy Chaperone_. This season, I’ll be serving as the sound designer for _The Living_. This show will be an especially interesting experience because of its entirely virtual setup!

Outside of school, I’ve done other theater-related activities over the summers. I interned for the [Historic Masonic Theatre](https://historicmasonictheatre.com/) as a technician, and I studied abroad in London for a month for a course on Shakespeare!

After graduation, I am hoping to attend graduate school and work towards an MFA in Sound Design. There’s still a lot for me to learn about sound design and engineering, so I’m looking forward to hopefully continuing my studies and getting to experiment more within a variety of mediums. We’ll see where things go after that — I’ll be happy as long as I’m working with sound somehow!

In my personal time, I’m trying to learn how to cook better, so I watch a lot of cooking channels such as Binging with Babish and Joshua Weissman. (Personally, I’m proud that I learned to make some different varieties of hashbrowns over the summer!) I also really like playing Picross and Sudoku, two number-based puzzle games, to relax.

Beyond this blog, I tweet weekly at [@Madison91095](https://twitter.com/Madison91095) on Twitter for this course as well! If you’d like to contact me further, feel free to do so there or at madison dot ferris dot 17 at cnu dot edu. Hope to see you again soon!
