# TEI Coding: "The Yellow Wall-paper"

I was assigned the second column of page 653 from a periodical edition of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper”. This was done as part of a larger project to transcribe and code this periodical with TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), a form of XML (eXtensible Markup Language), using Oxygen XML Editor. As someone with absolutely no previous coding experience before this course, I was intimidated by this project initially. However, as will be explored in this post’s reflection, I felt quite comfortable with the format by the end of the project for a variety of reasons.

Before beginning to code in Oxygen, we completed a “TEI on Paper” assignment in class. Using Google Docs, we worked with a transcription of our column to annotate any features of the text that would require tags or special coding with TEI. Compared to many other students, I had a fairly easy passage to work with. During the “TEI on Paper” portion of this project, I realized that I only had three types of features to take note of: new paragraphs, em-dashes, and italics. Even though I had relatively few things to take note of, preparing in Google Docs made the project far easier to transfer to Oxygen rather than going in blindly.

Opening Oxygen for the first time was certainly a bit intimidating, but once I only focused on the portions of the program that I needed for this project, things became a lot easier. The TEI Header was overwhelming at first, but following along closely with the instructions during class cleared up any confusion I originally had. Moving on to the TEI Text felt much more like starting from scratch, since there were comparatively few tags there to start with.

Implementing tags into Oxygen was fairly easy, despite a few hiccups. Oxygen’s auto-complete function for tags was mostly very useful, though my cursor would often remain between the “p” and the “>” of the opening tag when doing so. Because of this, my paragraphs would occasionally break until I realized my error, but it was easy to adapt to once I figured out what was going on.

I also struggled with implementing italics on my first couple of tries, when I tried to just copy and paste the tags needed into Oxygen rather than typing them by hand. I believe I was failing to format the tags properly around the text that needed to be italicized, so typing it in by hand — with the help of Oxygen’s auto-fill suggestions — fixed the problem!

As mentioned before, I only had three types of features to encode, so coding in Oxygen went fairly quickly for me. The bulk of the work was just copying and pasting the transcription into the program, so adding tags was a quick task, and then my section of the project was complete!

Throughout the course of this project, I have gone from absolutely no coding experience to now having a basic understanding of TEI, XML, and Oxygen. I don’t think I would be ready to handle a larger project on my own, yet. However, I do believe that I now have a good starting point to research and learn more independently if I would ever want to continue doing so. Most importantly, I feel comfortable enough to branch out into other digital humanities projects in the future, and I am excited to see everyone’s work come together once this project is completed!
